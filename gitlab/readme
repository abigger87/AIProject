Rules


Ultimately: AI must focus on the task to advance all of society that benefits EVERYTHING equally
AI STRESS ON PROGRESS
Must be introduced slowly to other intelligence / environment
Objective testing must be completed on the intelligence.
Any interactions must be performed through investigation window(only humans interact with intelligence, not the other way around)
AI must embody the value to learn completely before acting - All variables must be known


To Do

#1 @Mention 1 Create Data intake system - At First limit the data inflow and rate
#2 @Mention 2 Determine the information's environment scaling from basic to complicated *** This determines strength of AI
#3 @Mention 3 Sort the Data through a connection process and store the data
#4 @Mention 4 The process of storing data will be a challenge to the point where the AI can solve the problem itself.
#5 @Mention 5 Fetching of information

#... @Mention ... Create files with suggestions

Ideas

To build AI - what is intelligence really? Is it the fundamental process of adapting the mechanisms to link data?
Pattern recognition - intelligent to conclude based on patterns? IMPORTANT
With all the data ai would collect, not realistic to diffute ai- as long as recognition working.
#1 Data intake will eventuallt occur from everything on the internet - At first suggestion is wikipedia
#1.2 Limits placed on filling the README.txt file with information
#2 Basic to complicated will determine the strength of connections
#3 Connection process established by reading snippets of information (README.txt) to understand information's connection
#4 Zip / compress files to store large data with brief readme that allows algorithm to select information in decisions
#5 Fetching of information occurs after README.txt is read

#... Include references.

Process

Building ai = start training to complete tasks by changing its source code to strengthen connections between specific things.
As long as everything begins to connect ai algorithm of firing neurons = process of focusing on information with strongest connections to the environment of the question / thing it needs to do.
Every piece of information's environment must be recorded by linking it to the information based on its strength
Eventually all the pieces will link with links of various strength.
Problems would be solved by looking at what it is and using the ai information and its links to get data from any data source such as google.
Biological intelligence - baby collects data for years before developing thoughts

Questions

How to make the connection establishing system(where and how to store the data)?
