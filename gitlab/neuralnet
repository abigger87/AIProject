neural network

Data classification
- connections classified by strength.
- open time thread of general data input
  - open sublevels
  - data should be linked to information by topic, time input and other events in that time thread


Data Retrieval
-When any piece of data interpreted locate data that falls in general topic and recall information
-should also take into account time
  - open thread when data classification should be checked if open, and its data should also be recalled, earlier the stronger


*****for neural net to learn its own network, must run through tests where data input given and the specific information recalled is tested with algorithms
  ******* if the connections dont find the data, neural should loom at similarities and strengthen the emphasis on those types of similarities
  neural network should find its own way to emphasize data connections
